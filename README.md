# Computer_Vision_Text_Recognizer
This project is a computer vision text recognizer that converts images  text to digital text. It uses morphology for better accuracy. The frontend was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while the backend was developed using Python.

Here are the pictures that I captured for testing purposes.
